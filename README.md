# Hi, IÂ´m @EmilFreijd.

Welcome to my public coding lab, currently my only repository is my own webpage [Freijd XYZ](https://freijd.xyz) that contains a lot of domain knowledge regarding, economics, investing, technology, information technology, management, music, etc.

Basically all there is to life.

I am currently dusting off my webdevelopment knowledge, taking an ITILv4 Foundation certificate and prepping towards the PMP certification process.

Although my coding skills may not be advanced, I have a lot of knowledge in business and IT and am always eager to learn and contribute.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me on Twitter @emilfreijd or LinkedIn at Emil Freijd.
