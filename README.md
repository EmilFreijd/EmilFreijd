Hi, I´m @EmilFreijd.

My interests include economics, investing, technology, information technology, management, music, and outdoor activities.

I am currently learning Python & Next.js and I´m always looking for new opportunities to collaborate on projects.

Although my coding skills may not be advanced, I have a lot of knowledge in business and IT and am always eager to learn and contribute.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me on Twitter @emilfreijd or LinkedIn at Emil Freijd.
